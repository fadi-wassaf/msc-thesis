Variability of manipulation and optimized readout are additional benefits of this design.},

The algorithm is general in the sense that the number of involved ports is unlimited. A great advantage of the new relation is that it is very suitable for incorporation in a computer program. The subroutines for interconnection of multiports have been implemented in a computer program for microwave network optimization. This program (MINOP) and some experimental results will also be discussed in the paper. Finally I will mention some results concerning the separation of multiport networks.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a modification of the vector fitting (VF) procedure for rational function approximation of frequency-domain responses. The modification greatly improves the ability of VF to relocate poles to better positions, thereby improving its convergence performance and reducing the importance of the initial pole set specification. This is achieved by replacing the high-frequency asymptotic requirement of the VF scaling function with a more relaxed condition. Calculated results demonstrate a major improvement of performance when fitting responses that are contaminated with noise. The procedure is also shown to be advantageous for wideband modeling of transmission lines, network equivalents, and transformers.},

This is achieved by replacing a set of starting poles with an improved set of poles via a scaling procedure. A previous paper (Gustavsen et al., 1997) described the application of the method to smooth functions using real starting poles. This paper extends the method to functions with a high number of resonance peaks by allowing complex starting poles. Fundamental properties of the method are discussed and details of its practical implementation are described. The method is demonstrated to be very suitable for fitting network equivalents and transformer responses. The computer code is in the public domain, available from the first author.},

  abstract = {With the increase of complexity and coherence of superconducting systems made using the principles of circuit quantum electrodynamics, more accurate methods are needed for the characterization, analysis and optimization of these quantum processors. Here we introduce a new method of modeling that can be applied to superconducting structures involving multiple Josephson junctions, high-Q superconducting cavities, external ports, and voltage sources. Our technique, an extension of our previous work on single-port structures (Solgun, 2014), permits the derivation of system Hamiltonians that are capable of representing every feature of the physical system over a wide frequency band and the computation of T1 times for qubits. We begin with a “black box” model of the linear and passive part of the system. Its response is given by its multiport impedance function Zsim(ω), which can be obtained using a finite-element electromagnetics simulator. The ports of this black box are defined by the terminal pairs of Josephson junctions, voltage sources, and 50Ω connectors to high-frequency lines. We fit Zsim(ω) to a positive-real (PR) multiport impedance matrix Z(s), a function of the complex Laplace variable s. We then use state-space techniques to synthesize a finite electric circuit admitting exactly the same impedance Z(s) across its ports; the PR property ensures the existence of this finite physical circuit. We compare the performance of state-space algorithms to classical frequency domain methods, justifying their superiority in numerical stability. The Hamiltonian of the multiport model circuit is obtained by using existing lumped element circuit quantization formalisms (Burkard et al., 2004; Burkard, 2005). Due to the presence of ideal transformers in the model circuit, these quantization methods must be extended, requiring the introduction of an extension of the Kirchhoff voltage and current laws.}

  abstract = {For superconducting quantum processors consisting of low anharmonicity qubits such as transmons, we give a complete microwave description of the system in the qubit subspace. We assume that the qubits are dispersively coupled to a distributed microwave structure such that the detunings of the qubits from the internal modes of the microwave structure are stronger than their couplings. We define “qubit ports” across the terminals of the Josephson junctions and “drive ports” where transmission lines carrying drive signals reach the chip and we obtain the multiport impedance response of the linear passive part of the system between the ports. We then relate interaction parameters in between qubits and between the qubits and the environment to the entries of this multiport impedance function; in particular, we show that the exchange coupling rate J between qubits is related in a simple way to the off-diagonal entry connecting the qubit ports. Similarly, we relate couplings of the qubits to voltage drives and lossy environment to the entries connecting the qubits and the drive ports. Our treatment takes into account all the modes (possibly infinite) that might be present in the distributed electromagnetic structure and provides an efficient method for the modeling and analysis of the circuits.},
