\chapter{Lossless Impedance Functions}\label{chapter:lossless_impedance}
We will begin by discussing immittance and scattering parameters that describe multiport networks. We focus mostly on the rational lossless impedance parameter, its synthesis, and network interconnections. We will also discuss a routine that can be used for reconstructing these rational parameters from electromagnetic simulation results.
